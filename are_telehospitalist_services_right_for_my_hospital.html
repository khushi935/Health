							<h1 class="mt-0">Are telehospitalist services right for my hospital?</h1>
							<p class="written_by"><b>Written by</b> Andrew McWilliams</p>

							<p><u><b>Intro</b></u></p>
							<p>Is your hospital having trouble recruiting and/or retaining hospitalists? Are you having
								trouble getting doctors to cover certain shifts, like nights or weekends? Are some or
								all of your current onsite hospitalists overburdened?</p>
							<p>If so, you are not alone. According to theSociety of Hospital Medicine’s 2020 State of
								Hospital Medicine Report, a median of 11% of all hospitalist jobs remain unfilled. Half
								of HMGs serving children only, half of HMGs serving both adults and children and close
								to three-quarters of HMGs serving adults only reported having unfilled positions in
								their HMGs during at least a portion of the year.</p>
							<p><u><b>Impact of the hospitalist shortage</b></u></p>
							<p><u><b>Higher costs</b></u></p>
							<p>What does the shortage of hospitalists mean for your hospital? Even if you are one of the
								fortunate hospitals able to hire enough hospitalists to meet their requirements, you
								will probably be paying more for them. In 2020, the average US hospitalist salary was
								over $272,000, compared with $215,000 in 2010. </p>
							<p>In order to cover some of the added costs, you may be pressing your hospitalists to
								increase their productivity, e.g., by making more billable visits faster. However, this
								strategy can be self-defeating; the pressure to increase billings can lead to physician
								burnout and more turnover, with the high costs that come with recruiting replacements.
							</p>
							<p>On the plus side, despite the addedsalary costs, the use of hospitalists does bring
								significant benefits, such as shorter average hospital stays. On average, patients cared
								for by hospitalists stay in the hospital nearly half a day less than those cared for by
								general internists. Treatment costs are correspondingly lower, whilemortality and
								readmission rates are similar.</p>
							<p>Even though the difference in the length of hospital stay is relatively small, the
								overall impact can be quite large when multiplied by the thousands of admissions that
								hospitalists oversee each year. An0.4 day shorter length-of-stay per case multiplied by
								5,000 cases annually can save 2,000 bed days and enable 500 more patients to be cared
								for each year without increasing the number of hospital beds.</p>
							<p><u><b>Empty positions</b></u></p>
							<p>Other, less fortunate hospitals are unable to hire the hospitalists they need, either
								because they cannot afford the cost, or because candidates are not applying for the
								available hospitalist jobs. Rural hospitals are particularly affected by the hospitalist
								shortage. Many hospitalists are not interested in rural practice and there are other
								issues preventing them from applying, such as limited job availability for
								spouses/partners, and community acceptance of hospitalists.</p>
							<p>The ramifications of empty hospitalist positions can be far-reaching, including heavier
								workloads and longer hours for other care providers, which may cause them to burn out
								and/or quit, compounding the hospital’s staffing problems. The hospitalist shortage is
								likely to lead to longer wait times for patients who then become frustrated,
								complicating the healthcare process and even adversely impacting overall outcomes. </p>
							<p>HCAHPS(patient satisfaction) scores can be impacted dramatically if patients do not get
								the attention they need from care providers. HCAHPS is a core component of value-based
								purchasing’s pay-for-performance and has a significant impact on hospital reimbursement.
							</p>
							<p>Low patient confidence in health outcomes and satisfaction with the entire rural hospital
								experience are also among the root causes of rural hospital bypass, i.e., rural
								residents starting out by seeking care directly from urban hospitals rather than their
								nearby local hospital. Rural hospital bypass is one of the major causes of rural
								hospitals’ declining inpatient census, which places further downward pressure on their
								revenues.</p>
							<p><u><b>The telehospitalist solution</b></u></p>
							<p>Telehospitalist services are a potential way to extend the services of a hospitalist to
								rural and other hospitals that otherwise might be unable to obtain or afford them. This
								can improve outcomes and bring the benefits of hospital medicine, including decreased
								hospital spending, to smaller communities.For telehospitalist programs that cover
								multiple sites, the cost is significantly less that employing individual on-site
								hospitalists to do low-volume work</p>
							<p><u><b>Pain points</b></u></p>
							<p>For an initial indication whether you should be considering telehospitalist services, ask
								yourself whether your hospital is experiencing any of these signs of strain:</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Trouble recruiting and/or retaining hospitalists</li>
								<li>Losing admissions to big city hospitals. Are local physicians telling patients to
									check into big urban hospitals?</li>
								<li>Low/declining inpatient census</li>
								<li>ICU turning away patients for lack of beds</li>
								<li> Unnecessary transfers and readmissions</li>
								<li> Underrepresented specialties</li>
								<li> Underserved population</li>
								<li> Nurses/physician’s assistants are main on-site care provider</li>
								<li> Imbalances among hospitals in a system, e.g., ratio of nocturnists to admissions
								</li>
								<li> Volume surges</li>
								<li> Long distance to central hospital</li>
								<li> Hard-to-cover shifts,e.g,, doctors resisting night shifts</li>
								<li> Overburdened onsite nocturnists</li>
								<li> Hospitalists with low work load</li>
								<li> Low volume of night-time admissions</li>

							</ul>

							</p>
							<p>The more of these signs you are experiencing, the stronger the business case for your
								utilizing telehospitalist services is likely to be. </p>
							<p><u><b>Financing the telehospitalist service</b></u></p>
							<p>Before a accepting a telehospitalist services provider’s proposal, ask yourself whether
								yourhospital has enough business to support thew service? You could argue, of course,
								that there is no way to place a value on improved clinical outcomes or patient
								satisfaction.</p>
							<p>However, you will need to convince your CFO that a telehospitalist service is going to
								generate sufficient revenues to pay for itselfThis can be a complex question, with no
								one-size-fits-all answer. Although this is a rapidly changing landscape,
								telehospitalistshistorically have not been able to generate much revenue from
								professional billing. Unlike in-person visits, Medicare has been unwilling to reimburse
								professional fees for telehospitalist visits. Although each payer is unique, most other
								(nonMedicare) payers have also been unwilling to reimburse for televisits. </p>
							<p>This situation has changed, at least temporarily, under the COVID-19 pandemic. To help
								relieve the pandemic’s strain on scarce hospital resources, Medicare has started
								reimbursing hospital televisits that involve real-time audio and video
								telecommunications between clinician and patient at the same rate as in-person
								interactions. </p>
							<p>Any long-term changes in the reimbursement of most telehospitalist services are not
								certain. For one thing, no one knows how long the pandemic will continue, which services
								will continue to be reimbursed by Medicare after the pandemic ends, and at what level.
								On the other hand,Medicare does pay for virtual specialty services such as telestroke,
								possibly paving the way for a new policy of reimbursing for telehospitalistservices. In
								addition, many states have enacted telemedicine parity laws, which require private
								payers to pay for all health care services equally, regardless of modality (audio,
								video, or in person).</p>
							<p>Amid this uncertainty, you should require prospective telehospitalist services provides
								to submit a detailed financial impact analysis as part of their proposal. Examine their
								assumptions and analysis critically, with the help of a consultant if you prefer.
								Discuss the financial impact analysis with the provider, and ask enough questions to be
								sure their proposal is financially realistic.</p>
							<p><u><b>Adequacy of the IT infrastructure</b></u></p>
							<p>Working with the potential telehospitalist services provider, ensure thatyou have
								adequate IT infrastructure, particularly broadband internet access, to support
								data-rich, real-time two-way communications with a high level of reliability between the
								hospital and the telehospitalist. If you have inadequate broadband, you should determine
								the availability of potential remedies before proceeding.</p>
							<p>As a short-term solution, some telecommunications providers are working with local
								hospitals to provide Wi-Fi hotspots where cellular services are available. Longer-term
								solutions are also in progress, such as the USDA’s Rural Utilities Service and The
								Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund (USF). These programs fund
								infrastructure deployment of broadband and telecommunications throughout rural areas.
